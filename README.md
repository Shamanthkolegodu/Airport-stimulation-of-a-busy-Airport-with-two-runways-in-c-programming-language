# Airport-stimulation-of-a-busy-Airport-with-two-runways-in-c-programming-language
Let us consider a small but busy airport with two runways, one usually used for landings and one usually used for takeoffs. 
Planes arrive ready to land or ready to take off at random times, so at any given unit of time, the runways may be idle or 
a plane may be landing or taking off and there may be several planes waiting either to land or take off. If one of the 
queues is empty, then both runways can be used for the other queue. Also, if the landing queue is full and another plane
arrives to land, then takeoffs will be stopped and both runways used to clear the backlog of landing planes. 
The simulation should run through many units of time.
